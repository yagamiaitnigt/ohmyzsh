### FAQ

[FAQ](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/FAQ).

#### Custom Directory

The default location is `~/.oh-my-zsh` (hidden in your home directory, you can access it with `cd ~/.oh-my-zsh`)

If you'd like to change the install directory with the `ZSH` environment variable, either by running
`export ZSH=/your/path` before installing, or by setting it before the end of the install pipeline
like this:

```shell
ZSH="$HOME/.dotfiles/oh-my-zsh" sh install.sh
```

#### Unattended install

If you're running the Oh My Zsh install script as part of an automated install, you can pass the
flag `--unattended` to the `install.sh` script. This will have the effect of not trying to change
the default shell, and also won't run `zsh` when the installation has finished.

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)" "" --unattended
```

#### Installing from a forked repository

The install script also accepts these variables to allow installation of a different repository:

- `REPO` (default: `ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh`): this takes the form of `owner/repository`. If you set
  this variable, the installer will look for a repository at `https://github.com/{owner}/{repository}`.

- `REMOTE` (default: `https://github.com/${REPO}.git`): this is the full URL of the git repository
  clone. You can use this setting if you want to install from a fork that is not on GitHub (GitLab,
  Bitbucket...) or if you want to clone with SSH instead of HTTPS (`git@github.com:user/project.git`).

  _NOTE: it's incompatible with setting the `REPO` variable. This setting will take precedence._

- `BRANCH` (default: `master`): you can use this setting if you want to change the default branch to be
  checked out when cloning the repository. This might be useful for testing a Pull Request, or if you
  want to use a branch other than `master`.

For example:

```shell
REPO=apjanke/oh-my-zsh BRANCH=edge sh install.sh
```

#### Manual Installation

##### 1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh.git ~/.oh-my-zsh
```

##### 2. _Optionally_, backup your existing `~/.zshrc` file:

```shell
cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.orig
```

##### 3. Create a new zsh configuration file

You can create a new zsh config file by copying the template that we have included for you.

```shell
cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc
```

##### 4. Change your default shell

```shell
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

You must log out from your user session and log back in to see this change.

We also need people to test out pull-requests. So take a look through [the open issues](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues) and help where you can.
